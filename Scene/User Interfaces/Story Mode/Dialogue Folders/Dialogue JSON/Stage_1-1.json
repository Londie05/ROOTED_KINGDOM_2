            "You did your usual chores.",

            "Your usual hobbies. Your usual past-time activities.",

            "Who knows what you're doing right now aside from yourself?",

            "But, in a moment, everything came to a standstill.",

            "It was a calling.",

            "Everything around you changed in the blink of an eye.",

            "So quick that it took you three seconds to realize—",

            "You are surrounded by goblins.",

            "Goblins look at you with lustrous eyes; their mouths drooling an abnormal amount of saliva.",
            
            "They are clearly craving—at you.",

            "Holding knives and axes, the goblin began approaching your position.",

            "A grin can be seen on their faces as they anticipate their eventual satiation, and your inevitable demise.",

            "Pushing your body with your feet little by little, you began dragging yourself back away from them.",
            
            "Then—",

            "Your world was engulfed in a smoke and obscured your eyes. ",

            "You covered your eyes to prevent the smoke from touching your eye.",

            "And as you contemplated on your own predicament, you began hearing the sounds of metal clashing with each other—",

            "A battle ensued around you."
